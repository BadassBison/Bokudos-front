## Code of Conduct
Treat everyone with respect and dignity

## Coding Standards
Only add libraries if absolutely necessary. This is a learning project, so we want to implement as much of our own code as possible.
Data is held in the global root state, everything else should be reduced down into a slice that that.
API's are microservices external to the Frontend project
