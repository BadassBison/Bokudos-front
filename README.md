## Description
Bokudos is a 2D battle royale where players fight as ninjas against eachother in realtime. 

## Architecture
Frontend is built with TypeScript, and Webpack as the bundler. 

StageBuilderAPI is built using .NET Core

## Coding Standards
Only add libraries if absolutely necessary. This is a learning project, so we want to implement as much of our own code as possible.
Data is held in the global root state, everything else should be reduced down into a slice that that.
API's are microservices external to the Frontend project
